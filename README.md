## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
    (**Note**: This did not make sense to me, as the display is supposedly the last 7 days of spending, hence the current day would not be in the middle of the graph. I interpreted the highlighted bar as being the bar with the highest spending, and programmed accordingly)
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart
